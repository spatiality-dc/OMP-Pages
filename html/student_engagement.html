  The Oxfam-Monash Partnership believes in building meaningful connections between students, Oxfam and the development sector more broadly. Firstly, because we believe that by doing so, we help to build a generation of aware, informed and inspired development activists, ready to drive positive global
  change into the future. And secondly, because we know that by mobilising their energy, creativity and commitment, young people can help to drive positive global change <em>today</em>.
</p>
<p >
  With this philosophy in mind, we have run a number of programs linking students in to the development sector. Click through the images below for more information on past and current programs.
