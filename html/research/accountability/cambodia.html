  Project Title: Steering Multi-Level Accountability Systems from the Ground Up in Cambodia

</p>
<h3>
  What is the issue?
</h3>
<p>
  Many communities across Cambodia are being displaced and their livelihoods are under threat due to large-scale infrastructure and development projects that they have very little understanding of or control over. These communities urgently need to find ways to have influence over these projects before&nbsp;&nbsp;they&nbsp;&nbsp;take&nbsp;&nbsp;place,
  and to hold the projects to account for their effects on their communities and environment.
</p>
<h3>
  What are we doing?
</h3>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  The research project sought to strengthen the ability of communities to hold external actors to account, by better understanding the barriers that currently prevent them from doing so. It also sought to more fully understand the factors that allow some communities to develop stronger accountability&nbsp;&nbsp;processes&nbsp;&nbsp;than&nbsp;&nbsp;others.
  It is intended that these lessons will be used by communities and other relevant actors to strengthen community-driven accountability processes, and to protect community livelihoods as a result.
</p>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  To achieve this, the research team worked with three communities that have been affected by infrastructure and development projects, NGO interventions and the activities of financial institutions and transnational business. In each community, the research team engaged extensively with a broad range&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;community&nbsp;&nbsp;members
  to understand how they perceive accountability processes, where they turn to raise issues and grievances, and what their capacity has been to influence external decisions. The project also explored how NGOs and other actors can have an impact on or enhance these processes.
</p>
<h3>
  What are we finding?
</h3>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  Due to a lack of clear information, community members are often unable to identify the key actors behind the development projects that affect their communities. This presents a major barrier to their ability to hold these actors to account. Communities also have little to no experience of the processes&nbsp;&nbsp;involved&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;demanding
  accountability from external actors, and are therefore unaware of where to direct their questions, concerns and grievances regarding development projects.
</p>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  In this context, the team has uncovered&nbsp;a range of factors that may strengthen or detract from the capacity of communities to influence decisions and hold external actors to account. These findings are crystallized in the analysis and reports linked at the bottom of this page.&nbsp;For more detailed&nbsp;&nbsp;information&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;the
  project and its emergent findings, click on the links below.

<h3>
  What is the impact?
</h3>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  The findings of this research point to a number of new ways in which NGOs and other actors can help build the capacity of communities to hold external actors to account. By sharing these findings directly within Oxfam and its affiliates, as well as by disseminating key lessons throughout the development&nbsp;&nbsp;sector&nbsp;&nbsp;more&nbsp;&nbsp;broadly,
  the research helps to enhance the support that is provided to communities seeking accountability in Cambodia. The research findings also contribute to the current international debates around accountability, citizenship and governance, providing new insights to further these discussions&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;influence&nbsp;&nbsp;practice
  on the ground.
</p>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  During the field work, the research team also conducted participatory mapping activities and feedback sessions with the case study communities, helping to clarify viewpoints and identify information gaps and potential strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that the results of these sessions will assist&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;communities&nbsp;&nbsp;in
  their actions and inform the work of supporting NGOs.
