  Project Title: Developing a People's Policy for Health in South Africa

<h3>
  What is the issue?
</h3>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  For many disadvantaged people in South Africa, quality health services are unaffordable and inaccessible. While a privileged few are able to access high quality private health services, more than 80% of the population is forced to rely on an under-resourced, substandard public health system.
</p>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  In this context, the government is currently developing a National Health Insurance scheme, to be phased in over a period of 14 years. The National Health Insurance scheme (NHI) will completely restructure the national healthcare system, and aims to ensure universal access to efficient, high quality&nbsp;&nbsp;health&nbsp;&nbsp;services.
</p>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  However, there is great concern that disadvantaged communities are not being properly consulted or included in the drafting and implementation of the NHI. As such, there are fears that the new system may ultimately fail to meet the real needs of those that will need it the most.
</p>
<h3>
  What are we doing?
</h3>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  In light of these concerns, the research team actively engaged with a number of communities to help make sure that South Africa's vulnerable and disadvantaged populations benefit from the proposed health sector reforms. The key focus areas of this work were as follows:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Working with communities to help them identify and understand their health service needs
  </li>
  <li>
    Developing and disseminating plain language information booklets and working with communities to build understanding of the proposed NHI reforms
  </li>
  <li>
    Strengthening the ability of communities to engage with government in the design and implementation of the NHI, to hold them accountable for the provision of a system that meets their health needs
  </li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  Through a number of community-based organisations, the research team also facilitated training sessions and consultations to assess how useful the NHI information booklets have been in enhancing community understanding of the NHI process, as well as how effectively they have enhanced community capacity&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;contribute&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;NHI&nbsp;&nbsp;drafting&nbsp;&nbsp;process.
</p>
<h3>
  What are we finding?
</h3>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  The research team found that creating and distributing plain language education materials increased the level of knowledge and awareness among communities of what the NHI involves. This process consequently enhanced community interest in the drafting process, and generated a greater desire to know more&nbsp;&nbsp;about&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;NHI&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;how&nbsp;&nbsp;to
  be involved in the policy process.
</p>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  The sessions conducted with communities also enabled them to engage with the issues around the NHI, and they were able to raise questions and concerns that will now be communicated directly to the Department of Health for consideration.
</p>
<h3>
  What is the impact?
</h3>
<p>
  The model employed by the research team has had a significant impact on enhancing active citizenship and public participation in the South African health sector reforms. This model has the potential to be replicated more broadly to promote active citizenship in other policy areas, thereby strengthening&nbsp;&nbsp;democratic&nbsp;&nbsp;accountability.The&nbsp;&nbsp;lessons&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;this&nbsp;&nbsp;project
  are also informing the design of an Essential Services Program for Oxfam in South Africa.
