<h3>
  What is the issue?
</h3>
<p>
  One of the fundamental goals of international development work is to empower communities on the ground. Yet in the long and complex development chain, the voices of communities are not always brought up to and fully represented in decision-making, advocacy and policy processes. What's more, there is&nbsp;&nbsp;often
  poor information flow to communities, including on the issues that affect them most, which can result in 'informational poverty', isolation and disempowerment. In this context, there is a real and pressing need to find practical ways of bringing community voices into the decision-making processes&nbsp;&nbsp;that
  affect them, and of improving the delivery of relevant information to those at the ground level.
</p>
<h3>
  What are we doing?
</h3>
<p>
  To address these concerns, the Empowering Community Voices Project aims to explore how the Oxfam-Monash Partnership's research programs can best contribute to raising community voices, and to ensuring that they are heard and represented in the planning of international development initiatives. Furthermore,&nbsp;&nbsp;the
  project seeks to trial new and innovative ways of improving the flow of relevant information to and from communities in real time. By working with the Partnership's research project teams and local communities in South Africa and Bangladesh, the project seeks to better understand how Participatory&nbsp;&nbsp;Action
  Research and Information and Knowledge Management may overcome the informational barriers that communities currently face, and consequently empower communities in their day-to-day lives.
</p>
<h3>
  What are we finding?
</h3>
<p>
  Scoping visits have now been completed in South Africa and Bangladesh, and have established a strong foundation for further experimentation in the next phase of the project. The ongoing findings of the work will be regularly uploaded to this page as they emerge.
</p>
<h3>
  What is the impact?
</h3>
<p>
  Though there is a clear desire within the development sector to empower communities 'from the bottom-up', development agencies and their community partners currently lack practical tools to make this a reality. By developing new communications, information and knowledge skills in conjunction with beneficiaries,&nbsp;&nbsp;the
  project will provide a new mechanism through which communities will be better able to influence the decisions that affect them, and to hold external actors to account for the impacts they have on their lives.
