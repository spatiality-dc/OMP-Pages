  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, on Gender Equality, calls for ending all forms of discrimination against women and girls. It is both a basic human right and crucial to accelerating sustainable development. Empowering women and girls is proven to have a multiplier effect, and contributes to overall
  social and economic development.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
  Building on past achievements, SDG 5 provides an opportunity to address gender equality. Inequality, discrimination and social exclusion persists worldwide. Women, minorities and the disabled are the most affected, often limiting their equal participation in political leadership, community and household
  decision-making processes as well as access to economic and social services. This can lead to gendered impacts such as conflict, gender and sexual-based violence and exploitation.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
  Through the Oxfam-Monash Partnership research, we examine how gender mainstreaming across key sectors such as agriculture and climate change adaptation can address gender equality and mitigate gendered impacts of humanitarian crises.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also study the effectiveness of stand-alone gender justice
  programmes, including gender-based violence (GBV) and women&rsquo;s economic empowerment (WEE), to create transformative change on gender justice.
