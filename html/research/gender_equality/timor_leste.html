<p><strong>What is the issue?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Microfinance programs are the &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; grassroots networks in which to introduce new ways of thinking about gender to men and women (Mayoux 2005). And, whilst there is significant support for women-only microfinance programs as a strategy to increase gender equity, there is very little
  evidence of gender analysis of the social dynamics and outcomes resulting from mixed-gender microfinance groups, such as the majority of groups in Timor-Leste.
</p>
<p><strong>What are we doing?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  This research is aimed to examine the gendered social dynamics and impact (positive and negative) of Oxfam-partnered diverse SLGs in Timor-Leste, and further sought to understand the social dynamics of the SLGs to ensure that any negative impacts are mitigated and positive benefits are maximized.
</p>
<p>
  The project will work with 17 microfinance groups and key stakeholders to identify the enabling and inhibiting factors that contribute to women&rsquo;s participation and leadership in the groups, which will inform and improve Oxfam&rsquo;s SLG program design.
</p>
<p><strong>What are we finding?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  One key finding has been that while SLGs provided economic and social successes for all participants, it was however clear that groups demonstrated adherence to established gendered roles and economic strategies, which often did little to challenge gender inequity and associated attitudes. In particular,
  women, identified as being more trustworthy and transparent were confined to roles of treasurers and secretaries while men were generally noted as better suited for leadership roles.
