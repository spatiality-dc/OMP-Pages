  Project title: Transforming Harmful Social Norms in Solomon Islands

<p><strong>What is the issue?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A comprehensive national prevalence study of violence against women and girls, using the WHO multi-country Study on Women&rsquo;s Health and Domestic Violence methodology, was conducted in 2009 in Solomon Islands. This Family Health and Safety Study found that 64% of ever-partnered women had experienced
  physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner since the age of 15. The same survey found that 37% of young women aged 14-29 reported that they had been sexually abused before the age of 15, and 38% reported that their first sexual encounter was forced. The same study showed that nearly three-quarters
  of Solomon Islands women think that a man is justified in beating his wife under some circumstances.
</p>
<p>
  Safe Families is the first long-term, intensive, locally-developed community mobilization-based violence prevention program to be implemented in Solomon Islands. The project model facilitates sustained normative change by mobilising communities to understand the root causes of family and sexual violence,
  and to take action to address these causes. Safe Families also includes a significant focus on addressing systemic drivers, such as policies, access to resources, and coordination of stakeholder response. The intervention is currently being implemented in Malaita and Temotu provinces as a part of a 10
  year strategic initiative supported by the Australian Government to prevent and respond to family and sexual violence in Solomon Islands.
</p>
<p><strong>What are we doing?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Safe Families primary prevention intervention, and to understand the processes of change to harmful social norms that drive family and sexual violence in Solomon Islands.
</p>
<p>
  This research is supported by the World Bank Sexual Violence Research Initiative and will contribute to building the evidence for primary prevention of family and sexual violence in Solomon Islands and globally, in a number of important ways:
</p>
<p>
  1. Expanding the evidence from the Pacific region &ndash; The Pacific has some of the highest rates of violence against women globally. However, evidence on the effectiveness of any primary prevention interventions from the region remains scarce.
</p>
<p>
  2. Growing the evidence from post-conflict, high prevalence settings &ndash; This research will provide much-needed nuanced evidence on what works to prevent violence in low resource, post-conflict, high prevalence settings such as in Solomon Islands.
</p>
<p>
  3. Increasing the evidence of social norms driving violence against women &ndash; Identifying the contextually-specific social norms that underpin violence against women, and what works to address them, will represent a significant advance in knowledge and an excellent complement to Solomon Islands
  national prevalence figures.
</p>
<p>
  4. Progressing methodological approaches to researching violence against women &ndash; This research project will advance our understanding of how to conduct research on violence against women that is ethical, safe and rigorous in the context of small, geographically disparate communities where violence
  is relatively normalised.
