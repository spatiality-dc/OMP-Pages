  Project Title: Gendered impacts of climate variability, particularly in relation to slow-onset change and climate events in Bangladesh
</h3>

<h3>
  What is the issue?
</h3>
<p>
  Climate change is exacerbating the scale, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in Bangladesh, including increased floods, cyclones and storm surges. There have also been increasing slow-onset events, including droughts and salinisation of land and water resources. These events are causing&nbsp;&nbsp;ongoing
  losses of lives, homes and livelihoods throughout the country. Yet there is little understanding of how these changes are specifically affecting women and men, and of how women's&nbsp;safety and security is being particularly compromised by climate change events. There is therefore a real need&nbsp;&nbsp;to
  determine how women in Bangladesh are being specifically affected by a changing climate, and to identify strategies that could support them to improve their lives and livelihoods in response.
</p>
<h3>
  What are we doing?
</h3>
<p>
  Working across three communities in Bangladesh, the research team conducted focus groups and interviews to better understand how men's and women's livelihoods differ within these communities. In particular, the team worked&nbsp;to identify the impacts that climate change has so far had on issues such&nbsp;&nbsp;as
  food security, employment, education and health, and how these impacts have been affecting men and women differently.
</p>
<h3>
  What are we finding?
</h3>
<p>
  Across all three communities, climate change has had a range of detrimental impacts on livelihoods, and has exacerbated existing gender inequalities. In particular, declining yields from agriculture and fisheries has driven a significant number of men to out-migrate for employment, leaving women to&nbsp;&nbsp;cope
  with and adapt to the changes occurring in their communities. This out-migration has also changed family relationships and has led to increases in domestic violence against women. Meanwhile, women have suffered disproportionately from food shortages and from reduced availability of fuel and drinking&nbsp;&nbsp;water.
  Finally, girls' access to education has been put under pressure by increasing financial hardship, with families increasingly unable to support their ongoing education, and with some families&nbsp;pulling their daughters out of education in favour of early marriage.
</p>
<h3>
  What is the impact?
</h3>
<p>
  The team's findings fill an important gap in broader understandings of gender and climate change, and the research team has worked&nbsp;to help fashion effective policy and responses to these challenges. The findings also point to new ways in which NGOs can more effectively help to mitigate the impacts&nbsp;&nbsp;of
  climate change on women in Bangladesh.
