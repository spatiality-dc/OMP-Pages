  The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda has recognized for the first time the contribution of migration to sustainable development. Migration is a cross-cutting issue, relevant to all of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In particular, 11 out of 17 goals contain targets and indicators that are
  relevant to migration and displacement. The Agenda's core principle to "leave no one behind", explicitly includes refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants.

<p style="text-align: justify">
  The number of people forcibly displaced is now at its highest since records began. Global population dynamics are changing, and the relationship between migration, displacement, conflict and urbanisation will become increasingly complex and important in the forthcoming decades. Whilst movement of people
  is normal, there are particular challenges and complexities to irregular and forced migration especially in the Asia Pacific region, where displacement and irregular migration is an increasingly pressing issue.
</p>
<p>
  The Oxfam-Monash Partnership supports research that aims to improving understanding of the drivers and consequences of multiple migrations, including regular, irregular and forced displacement as part of the migration and displacement thematic area.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our research is also focused on examining
  the social impact of family separation on refugee resettlement and social inclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our research findings are used to inform Oxfam&rsquo;s policy influencing efforts, practice and beyond.
