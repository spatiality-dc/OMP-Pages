  What was it?
</h3>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  Oxfam-Monash Innovators was an initiative of the Oxfam-Monash Partnership, giving passionate students the chance to drive real-world change with their own new and creative ideas.<br /><br />Open to all Monash students, in 2013 and 2014 the Innovators program gave participants an opportunity to develop and pitch their own original ideas to a major international NGO &ndash; Oxfam Australia.<br /><br />During the program, participants worked in teams with a range of expert mentors
  to tackle a challenge that Oxfam was looking for fresh young minds to help solve. Groups pitched their solutions to a panel of judges, and the most exciting and innovative idea was awarded funding and mentoring to help make it a reality.
</p>
<p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
  The Innovators program ran over two weeks, during which time students were guided by expert mentors to develop their project idea, and to hone their pitching and presentation skills. The final presentation night was attended by individuals from across the development sector, and a panel of expert judges
  who choose the winning solutions.

  The 2013 winners of the Oxfam-Monash Innovators program have gone from strength to strength since proposing the idea for &ldquo;The Sustain Me&rdquo; mobile app. An app aimed at making recycling easy, the &ldquo;Sustain Me&rdquo; mobile app will provide easy&nbsp;&nbsp;access to information on what&nbsp;&nbsp;can&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;recycled,&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;how&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;each
  council. The team responsible for the app hope that this will positively change the behaviour of users and therefore improve recycling and enable people to live more sustainably.<br /><br />The app is available for free through Google Play and the App Store.

  fuzzy feeling" of receiving&nbsp;&nbsp;an Unwrapped card beyond Christmas day itself, through pairing the card with a tangible, lasting gift.
