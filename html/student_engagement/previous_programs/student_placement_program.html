	<h3>
  What was it?
</h3>
<p>
  The Student Placement program closed with the Oxfam Australia South Africa office, which now operates as Oxfam Southern Africa. We are delighted that so many Monash students could contribute to this incredible program, and grateful for the many community partners who made this program possible.
</p>
<p>
  The South Africa Student Placement Program provided Monash students with an amazing opportunity to gain first-hand experience of international and community development work, through placements with Oxfam and its partner organisations in South Africa.
</p>
<p>
  Over a six-week or semester length placement, students worked with Oxfam South Africa or one of its local partners:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hillcrest AIDS Centre Trust:</strong> An organisation that provides holistic care and prevention services for people affected and infected by HIV and AIDS in the outer-west region of Durban
  </li>
  <li><strong>Refugee Social Services:</strong> An organisation that supports the refugee and asylum seeker population in Durban and KwaZulu-Natal by promoting protection, social integration and self-reliance
  </li>
  <li><strong>Woza Moya:</strong> A rural community-based organisation in KwaZulu-Natal, primarily focused on HIV prevention, healthcare and poverty alleviation
  </li>
  <li><strong>Project Empower:</strong> An organisation that provides training and support to young women to confront unequal gender power relations
  </li>
  <li><strong>Justice and Women:</strong> An organisation that provides education to communities on women's rights, and assists women in exercising these rights
  </li>
  <li><strong>KwaZulu Regional Christian Council:</strong> A capacity-building organisation that strengthens the ability of local churches to deliver poverty alleviation programs
  </li>
  <li><strong>Tholulwazi Uzivikele:</strong> An organisation that supports community empowerment processes and seeks to address HIV and AIDS
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Students worked with their host organisations in-country to determine how they can best contribute during their time on placement. As such, the roles that students performed during the program were flexible and varied. In all cases, however, students came away with a deepened understanding of community
  development, a greater awareness of issues such as HIV and AIDS, and a range of invaluable skills that can be used in their ongoing studies and future careers.
