  Each year, the Oxfam-Monash Partnership helps to bring Oxfam staff and Monash students together through undergraduate and postgraduate course offerings as guest lecturers and advisors.
</h3>
<p>
  .
</p>
<p>
  We facilitate a guest lecture series which benefits students studying undergraduate and postgraduate course offerings each semester.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout the series, Oxfam staff provide Monash students with practical learnings and unique insights into the international development field.
</p>
<h3><strong>2018 Lecture Series</strong>
</h3>
<p>
  OMP and Oxfam staff contributed to a number of Masters-level units and other programs at Monash University in 2018. With their extensive on-ground experience, these speakers brought an invaluable practical perspective to these courses, and provided a unique opportunity for students to move beyond theory
  in their studies and develop a real understanding of how development issues are tackled in practice.
</p>
<p>
  These experts shared their expertise on areas including:

    <p>
      In&nbsp;<a href="http://www.monash.edu/pubs/2018handbooks/units/APG5628.html">APG5628 Deconstructing Development</a>, students heard from John Siddham (Program Information Coordinator, Oxfam Australia) on the role of NGOs in development. Students participated in an activity based on the old adage &lsquo;the
      blind leading the blind&rsquo; which was designed to stimulate discussion about the need to look at situations from the perspective of the communities that development agencies work with and the need for these organisations to have the culture to change within themselves.

      In&nbsp;<a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/units/APG5140.html">APG5140 Guiding Principles for Professionals Engaged in Disaster and Humanitarian Crises</a>, Jennifer Worthington (Humanitarian Coordinator, Oxfam Australia) delivered an interactive and engaging seminar about Oxfam as an International
      NGO; principles of the roles of NGOs in disasters and humanitarian crises including adherence to the core humanitarian standards; and approaches to protracted crises versus rapid humanitarian responses. The session involved an in-depth discussion centred around the background preparation work required
      to facilitate humanitarian response, and ways of capacitating local partners to be the first responders, following the global push to support local partners to be at the forefront of disaster response.

      In the session for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/2018handbooks/units/APG5045.html">APG5045 Gender and Development</a>, Dr Saba Mebrahtu Habte (Program Lead, OMP), Anila Aftab-Schroers (Gender Advisor - Economics, Oxfam Australia) and Courtney May (Programme Officer, OMP) provided students with a valuable opportunity
      to undertake a deep dive on selected savings-led microfinance programs being implemented by Oxfam and other civil society organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Mebrahtu shared a comprehensive review of the existing world-class research on microfinance interventions and women&rsquo;s empowerment. This was aligned
      to the outcome of the Women&rsquo;s Empowerment and Microfinance in the Asia Pacific (WEMAP) workshop held in November 2017, jointly organized by Dr Sara Niner (Lecturer and Director, Master of International Development Practice, Monash University).

      Perspectives on sustainability
    </h3>
    <p>
      In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.monash.edu/msdi/study/extracurricular/greensteps">Green Steps 2018</a>, Dr Saba Mebrahtu Habte (Program Lead, OMP) delivered a session as part of the Monash Sustainable Development Institute initiative, drawing upon her expertise on social inclusion and gender. In a &lsquo;deep
      dive&rsquo; style workshop, Saba facilitated an informative interactive session covering an array of topics with the underlying theme of moving from social exclusion to social justice. Students were also excited to take part in a practical exercise in which they applied key power analysis questions for
      examining the gender power dynamics that had arisen within a practical field-based case study about enhancing women&rsquo;s participation in the market economy.
