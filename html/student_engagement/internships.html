  Student Testimonials
</h3>
<p>
  Courtney May interned with the Oxfam-Monash Partnership in the second half of 2017 as part of her Masters degree program. Currently completing the final stages of her Masters in Environmental Management and Sustainability, she went on to secure ongoing employment with OMP upon completion of her internship
  as well as in the Supporter Services area of Oxfam Australia, whilst continuing to work with Monash academics in drafting academic discussion pieces around the workshop themes.
</p>
<p>
  Through her studies and volunteering interests more broadly, Courtney developed a keen interest in issues around environmental governance, climate change and resilience, and gender rights, discovering a distinct passion for understanding the effects of climate change on marginalised groups, particularly
  women. This led her to apply for the OMP internship during which time she assisted in the organisation of a workshop aiming to explore contemporary issues relating to the effects of microfinance on women&rsquo;s empowerment and poverty alleviation, focusing on the Asia Pacific region.
</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This internship was such an exciting opportunity to work closely with academia to attain a much deeper understanding of a contemporary development issue - without having to write a thesis - whilst simultaneously gaining more practical experience in this space. It was so eye-opening to be in the room for such an amazing discussion between internationally-renowned academics and development practitioners, and to go on to work further with the Oxfam-Monash Partnership is amazing.</em>
</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m now looking forward to working alongside the Program Lead in preparing a joint Oxfam-Monash position paper on microfinance and gender empowerment based on expert recommendations raised at the workshop, as well as having the opportunity to improve our social media and broader online presence.&rdquo;</em>
