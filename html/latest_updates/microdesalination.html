</div>

<div id="content_container_2048828">
<p>The lack of adequate and safe water is one of the major development challenges of our time. Together, Oxfam Australia and Monash University have developed a water purifier that is low cost, solar driven, compact, portable and can deliver clean water to vulnerable and water-stressed communities. The next stage involves field testing.</p>

<h4>What is the issue?</h4>
</div>

<div id="content_container_2048832">
<p>Water access is central to sustainable development, posing a major concern for global development practice into the future. The United Nations has recognised the importance of ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all through the establishment of SDG 6, with access to water also supported through other SDGs.</p><p>Over 2 billion people worldwide lack access to clean drinking water; this situation is only expected to be exacerbated by climate change and population growth. Both developed and developing countries will be affected by these challenges in different ways; rural off-grid Indigenous communities in Australia are affected by poor water quality resulting from salinity, turbidity, nitrogen and phosphorus issues, whilst countries in South and Southeast Asia particularly face challenges in the form of water overuse and intrusion by saline groundwater and other contaminants such as arsenic.</p><p>You can read more about water as a development challenge and key promising innovative solutions in this recent joint publication by Oxfam and Monash project teams in <a href="https://devpolicy.org/a-promising-path-to-improve-sustainability-of-water-treatment-systems-emerging-water-desalination-and-purification-schemes-20190715/" target="_blank">"DevPolicy: A promising path to improve sustainability of water treatment systems"</a> and in this interview with Jimi Peters (Oxfam Australia) and Professor Xiwang Zhang (Monash University) in <a href="https://today.design/essays/membrane-technology-and-the-future-of-water-access" target="_blank">"Today Design Magazine: Membrane technology and the future of water access"</a>.</p>

<h4>What are we doing?</h4>
</div>

<div id="content_container_2048836">
<p>Oxfam and the Monash Department of Chemical Engineering have jointly developed a solar-driven water desalinator and purifier that not only produces pure water from a variety of contaminated sources, but also is portable, low-energy and cost-efficient.</p><p>The water purification system makes use of the latest developments in membrane technology and solar power, making it more affordable than ever before. It is also more feasible, as the system is easy to use and maintain and is extremely robust. Weighing only 20kg, it can also be easily transported into hard to reach communities.</p><p>Oxfam has previously partnered with researchers from the University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to develop a 'road map' which identified a set of criteria to be met by emerging desalination technologies.</p><p>This road map has been used to inform the work we are doing currently. We have already developed and tested a microdesalination unit prototype under laboratory conditions, which meets the Oxfam road map criteria.</p><p>We are now ready to move to field testing of the unit, which will be supported by two recent successful funding applications to Monash Infrastructure and Perpetual Impact.</p><p>Following successful field testing, we will use findings on use, perceived health/economic benefits, and social and economic feasibility to develop a comprehensive business case and strategic scale-up plan.</p><p>We believe that our current phase is truly the ground floor of what we hope will be a game-changer in the provision of clean drinking water to vulnerable communities in Victoria and elsewhere, where access to clean water and grid electricity still remains a challenge.</p><p>Watch the video below to learn more about what we are doing.</p>
