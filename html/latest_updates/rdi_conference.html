<h4><br> About the conference</h4>
</div>

<div id="content_container_2048868">
<p>This year's Conference explored the leadership required 'to leave no-one behind', as an underlying principle of the Sustainable Development Goals. Discussions focussed on how leadership can and does advance inclusion and social change, as well as addressing not just the technical challenges of development but also the power, political, social and cultural dimensions that impact experiences of inclusion or exclusion.</p><p>An exciting line-up of speakers offered diverse perspectives on the theme, including the Hon Fiame Mata'afa (Deputy Prime Minister, Samoa) who explored her experience as female leader and the broader challenges facing our region in a changing world and in the face of challenges such as climate change; Srilatha Batliwala (Senior Advisor, Knowledge Building and Feminist Leadership, CREA) who discussed the concept and practice of transformative feminist leadership; and Dan Honig (Assistant Professor of International Development, Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies) examined the ways in which donor practice can better support local leadership.</p>

We also welcomed sessions by Monash University academics in areas including paradoxical leadership and public sector innovation.</p><p>Watch videos of the keynote sessions (including the Q&amp;A) on RDI's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB7YzvWxY0Oq0H-SIpNkpvg" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.
