<p><a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/21252030%20Agenda%20for%20Sustainable%20Development%20web.pdf">The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>, draws from and builds upon the preceding Millennium Development Goals, and was adopted by all 193 UN member states in 2015.
  The global framework outlines 17 ambitious goals and 169 associated targets covering a broad range of economic, social and environmental objectives.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
  &ldquo;This Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. It also seeks to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom. We recognize that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement
  for sustainable development.&rdquo; (United Nations Resolution A/RES/70/1)
</p>
<p>
  The scale and breadth of the SDG agenda is unprecedented, and its achievement is dependent upon the collaboration and commitment of stakeholders globally. The SDGs can only be fully realised through concerted and holistic efforts by a range of actors, including international development agencies. Whilst
  member states of the United Nations hold primary responsibility for the implementation of the SDGs, international non-government organisations like Oxfam Australia also play a key role in the achievement of the agenda.
</p>
<p>
  Oxfam&rsquo;s work has broad alignment with the SDGs, and Oxfam had already undertaken an depth <a href="https://www.oxfam.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Final-Timor-Briefing-Paper-SDGs_WEB.pdf">case study</a> on how the SDGs were making a difference to communities in Timor Leste.
</p>
<p>
  Our preliminary report utilised a range of qualitative mapping techniques to identify the alignment between the SDGs and Oxfam Australia&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.oxfam.org.au/what-we-do/about-us/assessing-our-performance/what-we-plan-to-achieve">six goals to change the world</a>. The report also details a number of case studies to illustrate the intersection with some of Oxfam&rsquo;s major international projects, providing an insight into
  how their existing programs contribute to the advancement of the SDGs on a global level.
</p>
<p>
  Mapping the SDGs provided an opportunity to commence tracking Oxfam Australia&rsquo;s contribution to the agenda. The project was intended to increase internal awareness of the rationale underpinning the global SDG framework. We hope that starting the conversation about the ways in which the SDGs align
  with Oxfam Australia&rsquo;s strategic goals will further critical discussion and engagement with the SDGs within the organisation and encourage greater evaluation of their portfolio of work against the SDGs in the future.

  As part of my recent research internship with the Oxfam-Monash Partnership, I was involved in a project mapping Oxfam Australia and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
