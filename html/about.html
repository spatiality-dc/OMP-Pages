<p>
  To find lasting solutions to the pressing development challenges of our time, we need strong partnerships. These solutions can&rsquo;t be achieved by one organisation alone.
</p>
<p>
  The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 17 &mdash; Partnership for the Goals &mdash; reflects global recognition that strong partnerships are paramount to achieve the SDGs. The goals are interconnected. So achieving them depends on tackling issues in more than one goal at a time.
  Oxfam Australia and Monash University aim to contribute to this by working in collaboration to tackle the root causes of poverty that affect people around the world.
</p>
<p>
  Since 2010, we&rsquo;ve been working together to achieve greater development impact than would otherwise be possible. The Partnership is a first of its kind and has a track record of working across multiple Goals. This provides us with valuable experience and proven policy expertise to achieve key targets
  set out in the SDGs. In particular, we&rsquo;re working towards SDG 17 (Partnership for Goals), SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).

    Our Mission
  </h3>
  <p style="text-align: start;text-indent: 0px">
    The mission of the Oxfam-Monash Partnership is to improve development practice and its outcomes for communities. At Oxfam Australia and Monash University, we have our individual or two missions, but we share one common goal: to improve people's lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    By combining our different yet complementary resources &mdash; Monash&rsquo;s world-class research and Oxfam&rsquo;s global development experience &mdash; we can create better outcomes for the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable people.
