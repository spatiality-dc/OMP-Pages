		The Oxfam-Monash Partnership is built on a simple idea - that working in partnership can achieve more than working on one's own.
	</p>
	<p>
		Development organisations and academic institutions both play key roles in global development and poverty reduction. Yet their impact can be much greater when these efforts are combined. Recognising this, the Oxfam-Monash Partnership was established to forge new solutions to development challenges, and to enhance the contributions of both Oxfam and Monash to positive global change.
	</p>
	<p>
		By bringing together the visions and strategies of these two globally-minded organisations, and by finding and pursuing opportunities to enhance one another's work and impact, the Oxfam-Monash Partnership is driving a range of exciting initiatives that are strengthening and enriching the work of the development sector in countries around the world.
